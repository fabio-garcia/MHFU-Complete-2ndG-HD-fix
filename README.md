## MHFU-Complete-2ndG-HD-fix

Personal small edit for theALXm and three5media MH2ndG and MHFU upscale projects. I've added the variant hashes to comply with FUC v1.4.0 as of Jun 2024.

## Installation

Move root folder to memstick\PSP\TEXTURES. Change folder name depending on your game ID:

- ULJM05500 - Complete/2nd G


## MHFU Complete

If you don't know what FUC is, take a look at https://fucomplete.github.io/docs/setup.html
